## Personal website

## Origin Story (Part 1: A long time ago, in a bathroom...probably)
About a year ago I asked myself a simple question.  I said, "self, I'm lazy but I need a new website, what do you think I should do?"

Of course I responded, "well, if you're that lazy you should just set up a WordPress site...or do something with Tumblr...I think you're still young enough to use that."

"Yea, but I hate WordPress...and I don't have enough of a gif library and I don't write enough erotic Harry Potter fanfic to really be on Tumblr--so what do I do?"

"Well, you're lazy so we need to make this a project.  You wanna teach people web development right?"

"Yeah...the fanfic thing didn't pan out."

"OK, so why don't you make a new site with Laravel and store it on Github and use that as a base to teach?"

Hmm, it seems like I stumbled upon a pretty decent idea, but isn't everyone doing this already?  Do I have something to add?  And how the heck do I get over being so lazy?  Well, it turns out I had some good ideas about that too!

So I said to myself, "hey, you use Twitter right? Pull in your tweets to the site, that way there's always fresh content."

"Ooh, I like that--I could pull in things from other sites too, like Github!"

"Nice, and you know what...blogging is cool, but you know what would be even lazier than typing words...make videos, post them to YouTube and syndicate them onto the site! Hey, you can screencast the whole project!"

## Wat.
