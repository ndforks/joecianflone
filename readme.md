# Personal website

Hi, I'm Joe and this is the code behind my [personal website](https://joecianflone.co).

## Specs:

+ Laravel 5.2
+ Sass
+ HTML5
+ jQuery
+ Heisenberg (my toolkit o' code)
+ The articles are written in markdown with a bit of YAML at the top as metadata, and transformed with CommonMark. They're saved into Dropbox and every morning at 9:15 I have a scheduled task that uses the Dropbox API to pull in new articles and updates.
+ Tweets are coming from Twitter -- every 15 minutes a scheduled task is run and I pull in any new tweets.
+ The site is fully responsive and uses flexbox
+ Fonts are Roboto
+ I've got some updates to make in the future, but it's working for now and pretty good :)
