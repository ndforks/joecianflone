         <p>Hi, I'm Joe and I'm a developer and business owner hailing from New Jersey.
         <p>My day-to-day programming is pretty varied. I enjoy working with both front-end and back-end systems and consider myself a full-stack developer. That term is probably a bit overused today so don't feel bad if you catch yourself rolling your eyes.</p>
         <p>If you'd like to dig a little deeper into my career feel free to message me on <a href="//twitter.com/joecianflone" target="_blank" title="Twitter">Twitter</a> and I can get you a copy of my CV to look over. If you're more of a meat-and-potatos kinda person, you can always check out my <a href="//github.com/joecianflone">Github profile</a></p>
         <h2>So What's this Site About?</h2>
         <p>At my core I really enjoy teaching. It's something I find myself doing at every job I've ever been at in one form or another. So I've decided to take the show on the road (er...Internet) and post some stuff.</p>
         <p>My goal is to post videos and write articles as time permits and to give concrete well-documented examples.</p>
         <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
         <p>This site is mine and mine alone, I don't expect anyone to be offended by anything I say, but I can assure you that, unless otherwise noted, these words are mine and mine alone.</p>
