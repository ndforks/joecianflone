         <p>Hi, I'm Joe and I'm a developer.</p>
         <p>I've been programming and building websites since IE6 was considered the pinnacle of browsing experiences. I'm a web standards evangelist who codes fully responsive HTML5 apps with Sass by default. I have also been coding Javascript for many years too and have been currently digging into and learning a lot more about the MVVM framework VueJS. While I started off as a front end developer, I was never satisfied with only knowing a portion of a development stack, so over the years I've learned PHP, MySQL, and a bevy of other technologies and frameworks.</p>
         <p>I've built large enterprise sites and custom CMSs for brands like <a href="//exxon.com" target="_blank">Exxon.com</a> and <a href="//hrblock.com" target="_blank">H&amp;RBlock.com</a>. I've built SaaS applications like <a href="//grasswire.com" target="_blank">Grasswire.com</a> or <a href="//simplestep.co" target="_blank" title="Simple Step">SimpleStep</a> and RESTful API/SDK development for e-commerce products. I also work on open source projects such as maintaining a Compass plugin for Laravel's Elixir project and Heisenberg, which is a front end toolkit I use a base for developing new projects.</p>
         <p>If you'd like to dig a little deeper into my career feel free to message me on <a href="//twitter.com/joecianflone" target="_blank" title="Twitter">Twitter</a> and I can get you a copy of my CV to look over. If you're more of a meat-and-potatos kinda person, you can always check out my <a href="//github.com/joecianflone">Github profile</a></p>
         <h2>So What's this Site About?</h2>
         <p>At my core I really enjoy teaching. It's something I find myself doing at every job I've ever been at in one form or another. So I've decided to take the show on the road (er...Internet) and post some stuff.</p>
         <p>My goal is to post videos and write articles as time permits and to give concrete well-documented examples.</p>
         <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
         <p>This site is mine and mine alone, I don't expect anyone to be offended by anything I say, but I can assure you that, unless otherwise noted, these words are mine and mine alone.</p>
