Sass is just awesome.  It has made creating CSS just that much better.  But I have one problem with it: colors.  How the hell do I store colors as variables in a way that makes sense?  Well, hold on to yer butts, because I think I **finally** have a solution.

## So What's the Problem?

Imagine the case where you're managing the [front end of a large website])//grasswire.com).  To the casual user this site looks like it has about 5 different colors in it: gray, blue-green (green-blue?), dark gray, white and black.  Well, that's not really the case.  There are 20 different colors.
